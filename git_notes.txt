Theory:
-------

Repository: The project files that need to be tracked together after each logical change (The collection of files/project)

commit: snapshot of the project when we decided to commit

detached Head: in a different commit than the latest commit

.git directory: hidden file to store meta data about the files in you repo, to see type ls -a 

HEAD: current commit

git status: which files have changed since the last commit

git init: Initialize a repo in a directory

git reset: remove a file from staging area if accidently added

git staging area: Intermediate area to choose what files need to be committed. 
 

Note:
-----

Commands:
---------
