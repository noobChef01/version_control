Theory:
-------

Repository: The project files that need to be tracked together after each logical change (The collection of files/project)

commit: snapshot of the project when we decided to commit

detached Head: in a different commit than the latest commit

.git directory: hidden file to store meta data about the files in you repo, to see type ls -a 

HEAD: current commit

staging area normally shows the lastest commit
 

Note:
-----
Ubuntu

Commands:
---------

git log: display the commits log for the repo

git diff: get difference between two commits, needs commit id (Min: first 4 chars of id)

git log --stat: the list of files that got changed in a commit and other useful info

git config --global color.ui auto: get colored outputs

git checkout id: go to a different version

git status: which files have changed since the last commit

git init: Initialize a repo in a directory

git reset: remove a file from staging area if accidently added

git staging area: Intermediate area to choose what files need to be committed. 

git checkout master: go to current master brach commit

git diff with no args: gives the difference between the working directory and the staging area

git diff --staged: difference between the staging and current commit

git reset --hard: reverse any changes to working directory and staging area
